Programming Exercise B
• The local taqueria wants you to write a program which tracks the
number of burritos they sell each day and help them analyze their
business. Unlike last time, they don't know the types of burritos
they will sell, or how many types of burritos there are, until the day
of sale.
• Your program should prompt the user for the number of different
types sold, and then get the names of types, e.g. carnitas, chicken,
vegetarian, etc. Then, ask the user for the number of burritos sold
of each type of that day. Print out a daily report listing sales for
each burrito type and total number of burritos sold.
• You must use two dynamically allocated arrays (i.e. use new to
create memory for them, and delete to delete them when
finished). You need one string array to store the names of the
burrito types, and one int array to store the number of burritos sold.
