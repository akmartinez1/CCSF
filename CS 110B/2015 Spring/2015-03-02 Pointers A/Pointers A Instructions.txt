Programming Exercise A
• The local taqueria has decided they need to raise their prices. In
order to soften the blow to their customers, they also want to rename
all their burritos to make them sound more desirable.
• Your program should create two arrays in main() - one string array
with 3 burrito types and one float array with 3 associated prices,
defined below:
string names[] = {"Carnitas", "Pollo", "Veggie"};
float prices[] = {6.95, 6.25, 5.95};
• Write a function which takes a string pointer and a float pointer as
parameters. It should add " Especial" to the end of each name, and
add 1 to each price. Do not use array notation, i.e. names[0], use
only pointer notation, i.e. *names or *(names+0). Demonstrate using
the function by calling from main and printing out the new menu.
raisePrices(string *names, float *prices)
