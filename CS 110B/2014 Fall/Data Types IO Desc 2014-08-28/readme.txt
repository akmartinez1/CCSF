Programming Exercise B

Write a program which does the following:

Ask the user for two baseball team names
Ask the user for the score for each team

Display the team names with their scores, and tell the user who won the game.

Also, tell the user if any of the following happened:

One of the teams had a low score (<3)

Both of the teams had a low score

Use a const int for a low score instead of the magic number of 3
