Programming Exercise

The SFPD fraud unit was happy with your program to help detect credit card 
fraud and have a new assignment for you.  They have given you a list of 20 
known credit card fraudsters at large, and want you to write a program that can
detect if one of them is attempting to purchase something at the local Target 
store.

Your program should ask the user for the last name of a customer who is 
attempting to use a credit card.  Then, search an array of names to see if this
name is on the fraudster list.  You must use the binary search algorithm.

Unfortunately, the SFPD has not sorted the list for you, so your program will 
need to sort the list first, using the bubble sort algorithm.  You can get this
file from my website and save it in your hills directory.
