Programming Exercise A

Implement the Rectangle class as discussed today.

Enhance the Rectangle class with new member functions:

double getPerimiter()
	returns the perimeter of the rectangle, i.e. 2*width+2*length

bool isSquare()
	returns true if the rectangle is a square, i.e. length is equal to width

Demonstrate your class works with a main function, that instantiates a 
Rectangle object, and shows .sample output for its functions working
