File Input/Output

Until now we have entered data manually or declared initialized arrays. We can
also use a file to read in data or write out data.

Need to #include <fstream>

Opening file for input:

	ifstream inputFile;
	inputFile.open("creditcards.txt");

Opening file for output:

	ofstream outputFile;
	outputFile.open("output.txt");


Closing file when done:

	inputFile.close();
	outputFile.close();

File input example.

Lets assume we have a file called creditcard.txt which contains a credit
card number stored as a long int -- the following code snippet reads it in:

	long int creditCard;
	ifstream inputFile;

	inputFile.open("creditcard.txt");
	
	if (!inputFile)
	{
		cout << "ERROR: Invalid filename\n";
		exit(1);
	}

	inputFile >> creditCard;
	
	cout << "The credit card number is: " << creditCard << endl;
	
	inputFile.close();
