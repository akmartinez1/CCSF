<h1 style=text-align:center>CNIT-132 Homework 1</H1>

<p>In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in XHTML or HTML5.</p>
<!-- Closed paragraph tag. -->

<p>We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code and the basic idea of this Homework is to learn how
    to use the validator from W3C.</p>

<p><img style="float:left;" src="oldboat.gif" alt="Image of an Old Boat">The image you see here will be used a lot in
    many exercises we will be
    doing in class! This is an old boat, probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the
    old times?!?! Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big boat made basically of wood and using
    the main power of the wind! Remember that this picture needs to be uploaded to the Hills Server (your account)
    together with this file you are modifying, otherwise, the picture will not be shown!</p>

<h2>Subtitle of our page</h2>

<p>It's funny to see this page being upgraded<br>
    We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code<br>
    and that's the idea of this exercise!</p>

<p>I am trying to build an unordered list here below. Would you be able to help me?</p>

<ul>
    <li>planning a web page</li>
    <li>studying the target audience</li>
    <li>following standards when coding</li>
</ul>
